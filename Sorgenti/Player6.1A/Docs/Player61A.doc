1. Foreword:
нннннннннннн

This little utility was first started just for fun about two years ago and
was meant just to my own use, but when I noticed that there weren't a GOOD
Protracker-compatible replay available and after I saw a few tries to fix
this (ProPacker, Prorunner, etc.) I decided to give other people a chance
to play their Protracker-tunes FAST!

When designing the moduleformat, I also included packing and this 6.1
packing method is the most efficient I've seen for this purpose.

Afterwards features like the two delta-formats have been introduced to keep
this player on the edge of development.

I also made a converter to make it easier to use PT-modules.  It uses
Reqtools and Powerpacker libraries (both by Nico Franчois) so it can also
load Powerpacked modules.  The converter is made as easy as possible to the
user.

The normal disclaimer:

The author cannot be held liable for the suitability or accuracy of this
manual and/or the program it describes.  Any damage directly or indirectly
caused by the use or misuse of this manual and/or the program it describes
is the sole responsibility of the user her/him self.


A few words about distribution:

This program is freeware.  You can distribute it as long as _ALL_ files are
included and not more than a nominal fee for copying is asked.  This program
can _NOT_ be used for commercial purposes without written permission from
the author and a contribution for development costs (like Coca-Cola :-).
If you have suggestions or remarks about this program, or if you find any
bugs, please let me know.

THIS MEANS: IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THIS IN COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE YOU SHOULD
AT LEAST ASK ME FIRST AND I WOULD BE GLAD TO RECEIVE SOMETHING AS A
COMPENSATION FOR THE TROUBLE THIS THING HAS CAUSED ME, BECAUSE MAKING THIS
HASN'T BEEN JUST FUN AND SUNSHINE... 

This was meant especially to software houses using this without my
permission, like Team 17: Where the hell did you get that P41 you used in
Super Frog from?!?  It was never released due to P50.  I just gave it to
some friends for beta testing...  If you want to clear your conscience,
contact me.

To everyone: If you're going to use this player in your commercial
software, you should know, that the one released is never the newest version
and is always somewhat cut down.  If you contact (and pay...) me, you get
misc stuff like sound effect engines with it, if you want.  And tidy
conscience...


The black list (programs using The Player without my permission (nor
money :) )

All are using the beta of P41A:

- Super Frog from Team 17 (see ya at Assembly'95...)
- OverDrive from Team 17
- Alien Breed II from Team 17
- Action Pool from Team 17
- Qwack from Team 17
- Kick Off 3
- Impossible Mission 2025 from MicroProse

At _least_.


Thanks to these firms for contacting me before using The Player:

Bloodhouse - Stardust (Hi Everyone!)
	   - Super Stardust
Core Design - Banshee (Hi S°ren!)

Why is this list shorter?



3. Requirements:
нннннннннннннннн

- An Amiga computer (For PC look out for MIDAS)
- Reqtools.library and Powerpacker.library
- about 30 kB of memory for the converter, and if converting, 2 * (number
  of patterns * 1024 + 1084) bytes for buffers
- Works on 512kB machines, but more memory recommended, especially for
  converting.
- Kickstart 1.2 or greater.
- Kickstart 2.0-style colors recommended (looks better)



4. Features:
нннннннннннн

- a very efficient method to pack the pattern data and play it VERY fast in
  realtime

- cut-down header compared to the original one (4 bytes info, 6 bytes/sample,
  8 bytes/pattern, 1 byte/position plus one byte for stopmark)

- removes all names, unused patterns, samples, data after loops, empty data
  after unlooped samples, commands with no use and some smaller things

- Delta format samples!  Samples have the same quality, but packing
  efficiency is better with for example Imploder or Powerpacker.  Look below
  for some stats!

- 4-bit delta packing!  Packs samples in ratio 1:2 with very little loss of
  quality.  Try it!

- nearly impossible to rip without finding the call to the init routine,
  except if the optional `P61A`-sign is used

- works on every Amiga, tested under KS1.2-3.1, from WB or CLI/Shell,
  detaches itself from CLI, supports WB icons, etc...

- loads files packed with Powerpacker, FImp or XPK (all references to
  Powerpacked files also apply to FImp and XPK files)

Should support modules with 100 patterns (At least in PT2.x from Noxious)
IF patterns are packed under 64kB in PASS 1... (pointers are only words)


Commands implemented at the moment:
  - NoiseTracker 2.0 commands (0-6,A-F)

  - Tremolo (7), Sample offset (9), Fine slides (E1/E2), Set finetune (E5),
    Pattern loop (E6), Retrig note (E9), Fine volume slides (EA/EB),
    Note cut (EC), Note delay (ED), Pattern delay (EE), Invert loop (EF)

  - finetune and tempo

  - NOTE!:Patternbreak (D) does NOT support break to a specified line,
    linenumber is just ignored!  This is due to my packing system.

Some notes concerning this:
ннннннннннннннннннннннннннн
(After reading the docs of Prorunner 2.0 I thought that maybe I should also
write some advertisement bullshit here, but I decided to stay in the
facts...)

- P61A is the fastest replay of these...
- Has the best packing as seen above...
- 4- and 8-bit delta samples (the first one to have these)...
- Fully system friendly if needed (allocates channels, CIA's etc.)...
- Works on all Amigas (the first released one to check the VBR)...
- Supports CIA-tempos (the first one with no processor waits)...
- Fully PC-relative replay (released before Cosmos...)
- Has the so-much-praised master volume control...
- Usecode-system
- User-friendly converter (unlike NP2.0, PP1.0 and PRU2.0)...
- Versions for Asm-One, DevPac3 and DevPac2...


Enough?  If you still want to use some of those other players, feel free...


IF SOMEONE COULD SEND ME PROPACKER 2.x, PLEASE DO!

5. P61con, the Converter:
ннннннннннннннннннннннннн

Note!: Do _NOT_ merge hunks in this file, because it uses two SEPERATE code
hunks for detaching.  If you do, it crashes straight away...

Shell usage: P61con [-q][filename]

-q	Be quiet.  The only way to stop playing is to give CTRL-C-signal to
	the DETACHED piece of code.  Use TaskX or similar.

filename to play.  No checkings made, so be sure it IS a P61-module!

WB usage is normal.  Double clicking on a modules icon or click on module,
shift and click on P61con to play it.



	1. Converting Protracker-modules:
	ннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннн

First a normal Reqtools filerequster asks you to select one or more
(supports batch-processing) modules.  If you select multiple modules, the
directory for the modules to be saved is asked.  Then loading with the 
Powerpacker library.  If you chose one module, the name and path for the
save are asked.  As the packing starts, an info requester with some bars and
statistics pops up.  If you are converting only one module and have sample
packing on, sample packer-selector appears.  When the job is done, save and
some statistics about the efficiency are shown.  If you have converted only
one module, also the Usecode is here.



	2. Playing modules:
	ннннннннннннннннннн

First the converter asks for a module and then loads it using the
Powerpacker library so it can also be packed with the Powerpacker :) DOES
NOT SUPPORT FILES WITH SAMPLES IN OTHER FILE!  If it finds P61 from the
memory, it informs it to play the module.  If not, a requester is shown with
the name of the file and a stop gadget below.  The play routine is the
system friendly tempo one, allocates channels with priority 127, a CIA-
timer and returns if it couldn't get something.  Should work with every
system friendly program.

To the guys at Triumph: I'd say this IS faster than yours and multitasks at
least as well as your IntuiTracker 1.50 (I crashed it about x times...) and 
works on <2.0 Kickstarts, too.  Anyway, this wasn't meant to be a kind of
player like yours, but maybe one is coming (depends on effort and requests
from outside).



	3. Converting back to Protracker:
	ннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннн

This option is disabled to partly because I want to give people some
peace from Perverter and alike ie. protect their modules from ripping.
(I of course have my own version, which has this option implemented and
enabled...)  So you have to make your own reconverter is you want to
listen the modules in PT-format.

Usage is easy, just load P61A-module and save it as Protracker-module.  Be
sure it IS a P61A-module, otherwise I can't quarantee the result...

Damn! The new ProWizard (version 2.16) supports P61A-format so 
in this version this feature is enabled, in request of Nemesis1 (Hi!).



	4. Sample packer-selector:
	нннннннннннннннннннннннннн

When you have sample packing-option on, a requester appears when you
convert only one module.  It is used to select which samples are to be
packed with 4-bit delta packing and has the following functions:

Original	-Plays the original sample.  Stop with right mouse button!
Packed		-Plays the sample after packing and depacking it.  This
		 sounds same as the final packed sample.  Stop with right
		 mouse button!
Pack		-Marks the sample to be packed.
Pack rest	-Marks this and the rest of the samples to be packed.
Don't pack	-Marks the sample NOT to be packed.
Don't pack rest	-Marks this and the rest of the samples NOT to be packed.

Use of keyboard shortcuts is highly recommended!



	5. Preferences:
	ннннннннннннннн

Default loading directory:	The directory converter first gives you,
				when you load Protracker modules.

Default saving directory:	The directory converter first gives you,
				 when you save ONE P61 module.

Default batch directory:	The directory converter first gives you,
				when you save multiple P61 modules.

Prefices:			These are used to mask files in
				filerequesters and put to the beginning of
				the filename when saving.  Can be up to 7
				chars long.

Two files:			If you want samples and rest of the tune to
				be saved in separate files.

P61A sign:			If you want the P61A sign to be inserted in
				the beginning of the module.

No samples:			If you're converting multiple modules with
				same samples, this disables the saving of
				samples.

Tempo:				Whether the player should use tempo or not.

Icon:				If you want the icon to be saved with the
				module.

Delta:				If you want to use 8-bit delta samples.

Sample packing:			If you want to pack samples to 4-bit delta.


6. P61, the Player:
ннннннннннннннннннн

This program was under work (and still is...) for quite a lot time.  The
idea came from Simply / Parallax, due to the fact that Multiplayer can't
play P50-modules without GMOD-header and that makes modules about 6kb
larger...  So I had to get working.  Two days before Assembly'93 I rewrote
this program completely in a big hurry, so please forgive me those bugs 
that _will_ appear.  Present program is basically the same, but plays
P61-modules.

The interface is now quite neat, small is beautiful?  Under KS3.0 those
proportional gadgets are quite nice.  Functions should be familiar to all
who have used some player program (Multiplayer, Smartplay etc.).  The only
special feature is that if you try to load a Protracker module and you
have P61con in memory waiting in its mainmenu, P61 gives this module to it
to be packed.  P61con saves it to the ram-disk and informs P61 to load it.
After loading P61 deletes the module from the ram-disk.



7. Using The Player in your own programs:
ннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннн

NOTE: The instructions for the binaryfile-versions expect you to have
loaded the file to a label called "Player"

The versions are in the same file and these topics describe the various
possible versions to compile the source.  Also the binary versions have
their instructions here.

Completely PC-relative!



	1. Normal VBlank version:
	ннннннннннннннннннннннннн

Options:
	CIA = 0
	system = 0
	nonlev6 = 0
	system = 0/1

	Exec = 1 if ExecBase is valid and 0 if not

This should be easy for all you who've used the ugly Protracker routine or
one of the millions of others.

Call "P61_Init" with the address to the module in A0 and the address to the
samples in A1 or if they are in the same file, clear A1.  If you have a
module with samples packed, put address to the sample buffer in A2.  Uses
all registers, so preserve them if you're going to use them afterwards.


IF YOU ARE USING INVALID EXECBASE:
нннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннн
Check the Base yourself and put it to P61_VBR or Player+P61_UseVBR.  You
can also get the VBR there, if using valid ExecBase.


TO CHECK IF MODULE HAS PACKED SAMPLES:
нннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннн
Check bit 6 ($40) of the offset 3 from the beginning (excluding optional
sign).  If it is set, the module has packed samples.  Size of the required
buffer is then at offset 4.


To play the music, call P61_Music every frame (with NTSCs who want to play
the tune in PAL-speed or vice versa, use the CIA-version).

To end the music and turn the DMAs off, call P61_End.

With system option = 1, allocation of channels and lev6-timer are included.
Returns non-zero in D0, if couldn't allocate something.

With the binary file, P61_Init is Player+P61_InitOffset, P61_Music is
Player+P61_MusicOffset and P61_End is Player+P61_EndOffset.

The source can be compiled with at least Asm-One 1.09 by T.F.A.
(the Best assembler around!).  A separate version for Devpac3 is also
included.  This version should be easy to make work under any assembler
with incbin command.

The maximum rastertime taken is under 6 lines on a normal 68000 Amiga.
Fast?  Invert loop can take it beyond that, though.  Everything has its
costs.



	2. Non-lev6 version:
	нннннннннннннннннннн

Options:
	CIA = 0
	system = 0
	nonlev6 = 1

This routine is basically the same as the lev6-version, but you have to
call P61_Setloop about 7 raster lines after P61_Music.  This system is done
to enable the use of those 7 lines.  So if have a routine, which fits to
these 7 lines, do it while waiting...

This is not too much slower compared to the lev6-version, but I'd still
advise you to use it if possible.  It makes your life a hell lot easier...



	3. CIA version with tempo:
	нннннннннннннннннннннннннн

Options:
	CIA = 1
	system = 0/1
	nonlev6 = 0

	Exec = 1 if ExecBase is valid and 0 if not

The first tempoplayer I know, which uses only the lev6-int and does _NOT_
use those fucking processor loops.  As fast as the normal lev6-version!

Otherwise normal init, but info for the setting of CIA is needed in D0:
0 - Autodetect, if PAL/NTSC, uses ExecBase->VBlankFrequency.
1 - Force PAL.  If you've destroyed the ExecBase, detect the timing
    yourself and use these force modes.
2 - Force NTSC

No further actions needed.  Returns non-zero in D0, if it couldn't allocate
something.  The player starts playing right away, so do _NOT_ call 
P61_Music.

To end, call the normal P61_End.

To enable using of tempo, set P61_UseTempo to some non-zero value.

If system is set to 1, allocations for timer and channels are included.
Use if possible.

NOTE: If you want to use this in your own program that needs synchronizing
to the beam, do one of these:

1. Do your routine in VBlank-interrupt.
2. Do your routine in copper interrupt.
3. If you do NOT have to wait for a specific line, wait for VBlank bit in
   INTREQR ($1e) and clear it afterwards.
4. If you have to wait for some specified line, disable Copper-interrupt 
   from INTENA ($9a), set Copper-interrupt bit in INTREQ ($9c) with Copper
   at the specified line and wait for the bit in INTREQR ($1e) in our own
   routine.  Clear it afterwards.

See the examples supplied.

Otherwise this WILL steal some frames from you time to time...



	4. 68020-versions:
	нннннннннннннннннн

Options:
	opt020 = 1

These are a bit optimized versions for the 020+ machines.  The difference
to the 000/010-versions is only a slight one and because those versions
take only a half of a rasterline on a 25mhz A4000, I think these are nearly
useless.  But if you really want to make a 020+ program or AGA-only stuff,
this is for you...

Can be compiled at least with Asm-One 1.15 by T.F.A.

Interface is similar to the 000/010-versions.



	5. Player61.i:
	нннннннннннннн

This is the include file of all the structures needed, if you're going to
compile the source.  Also if you are making some additions to this player
(like quadrascopes, etc.  (these kind of things are maybe coming, I already
have quite a bunch of 'em linked to this player)) you can look for the
information there.  First I was going to release this only as a binary
version, but after thinking a few more moments, I decided to make this
include file and release the source, just to make supporting and developing
of this product possible.



8. The Usecode-system:
нннннннннннннннннннннн

This system was created for fun on a sunny afternoon.  I got a crazy idea
of putting a code of which features a module needs to the beginning of the
source and let conditional compiling take care of the rest.

The main idea is to reduce the lenght of this massive player to the real
needs of the module.  So only the commands the module needs are saved to the
player.  Also if the module doesn't use finetune, a smaller periodtable is
used.  And finally if the module doesn't use vibrato or tremolo, the 512
bytes long vibrato table is left out.

What you have to do is:

Take down the Usecode shown in the requester after the converter has packed
your module (if only one module is being processed or from the filenote)
and put this code to the beginning of the source into the place for it.
Compile and you have a customised version for this module only.  Usecode -1
leaves all features ie.  compiles the full version.

for example: 
	use = $9f0f



9. Bugs?:
ннннннннн

Some of you might still remember (in horror...) the previous versions of
this marvelous :) player.  Those 4.x-versions were all more or less beta-
versions and that showed...  (previous versions weren't even released, thank
god..)

This version has gone through quite a hell of beta-testing, by myself,
my Good friends Janne Juhola (Simply/Parallax), Steffan Schumacher 
(Metal/Parallax), Kari-Pekka Koljonen (Moonstone/Hippopotamus Design),
AND ESPECIALLY Mikko Karvonen (Yolk/Parallax)!

Also thanks for reporting bugs / wanted features go to:

- Dr.Jekyll / Andromeda
- Shayera / Spoon

And the rest I can't remember at the moment, sorry!



10. Hellos:
ннннннннннн

A bit more hellos than in the converter to:

To all who make those nice multiformat-player-programs (Multiplayer,
Smartplay, etc.): If you want some information about this format to be
included in your program, or anything else, just let me know!

To Turbo and Marley of Infect (authors of Exotic ripper): You did it!  I
just ask how?!?  You say it's deep search and it surely is.  Fab prog!
The pattern format changed once again...  Some peace from Perverter and
the like...

To Gryzor (author of ProWizard): Hi! So how did it feel to make support
for P61? Well, now I can use the same program for all modules again, so at
least something positive ;)  Great program anyway!


And hellos especially to:

- Janne Oksanen / Stratos of Sahara Surfers -
Nothing special to say, but hello.

- Petteri Kangaslampi / Alfred of Sahara Surfers -
Thanks for help with the new format!  Hopefully MIDAS comes off great!

- Kari-Pekka Koljonen / Moonstone of Hippopotamus Design -
Great sendings (when coming...).  Happy with this? HiP is Really Cool!

- John Hinge / Shayera of Spoon -
Sorry for huge delay, but hopefully this gives some compensation...

envelope WITH stamps (or International Response Coupon) and I'll send you

same version!)  IF THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET, ABSOLUTELY NO REPLY IS
GUARANTEED!
